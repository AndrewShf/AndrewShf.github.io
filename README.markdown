Specifically:

 * Please review the CSS for css/layout.css as this file contains all the base layout overrides that differ from Skeleton.
 * Please do not use the diamond glyph since I want to keep that unique in my design. 

If you happen to find inspiration in my site, a link back to my web site http://julianyap.com and letting me know via Twitter would be appreciated, but is not required.
