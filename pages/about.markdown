# About me

Hello, this is Haifeng Shi. I am currently a fourth-year student at [Southwest Jiaotong University][swjtu],
majoring in Computer Science and Technology. As an undergraduate student, the journey of my exploration is more like *BFS* rather than *DFS*. In a long run, my ambition is to find a research-related job and give back to open source community by making useful projects. 

Here is my [R&eacute;sum&eacute;][r]
